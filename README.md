This project leverages Python to simplify the process of determining the cheapest grocery options required to bake chocolate chip cookies for budget-conscious shoppers. The primary objectives are to identify the highest rated chocolate chip cookie recipe, determine the most cost-effective grocery store to purchase the required ingredients, and find the lowest prices for ingredients across different stores. The code targets major grocery stores in Davis, CA and uses Python tools such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping and API calls to collect, analyze, and rank our data. The Shiny App was used to create an interactive visualization of the grocery and recipe results. The analysis reveals that the best chocolate chip cookie recipe on Allrecipes is “Best Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe.” Target is the most affordable one-stop shop for all the necessary ingredients, and price variations across stores emphasize the need for price comparisons when determining the most cost effective individual ingredients.
