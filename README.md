This project utilizes Python to simplify the process of determining the most cost effective grocery options required to bake chocolate chip cookies for budget conscious shoppers. The primary objectives of this project is to identify and sort the best rated chocolate chip cookie recipe, to determine the most cost-effective grocery store to purchase the required ingredients, and to evaluate the lowest prices for ingredients across different stores. The code targets major grocery stores in Davis, CA using tools such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping and API calls to collect, analyze, and rank our data. For interactive result visualizations, the Shiny App was used for display and mapping. The analysis reveals that Target is the most affordable one-stop shop for all the necessary ingredients due to its in-house brand Good & Gather, and price variations across stores emphasizes the need for price comparisons when determining the most cost effective individual ingredients.
